# 🧠 Machine Learning From Scratch (NumPy)

This repository is a collection of **from-scratch machine learning implementations**, built to deeply understand the **mathematics, optimization techniques, and numerical stability** behind core ML algorithms.

Each folder represents an **independent worksheet** with:
- Mathematical explanation
- Clean NumPy implementation
- Practical notes and pitfalls
